World of Warcraft addon that hides the annoying guild achievement spam that's been happening since 11.0.0 launched.

- Hides the guild achievement popup.
- Mutes the sound guild achievements make.
- Hides the guild achievement earned message from chat.

This small print message in the chat is all you're going to see when spam is prevented:
